# Dockerized static and dynamic login web applications

This project involves the deployment of two Dockerized applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with the Fargate launch type. The applications encompass Version1, a static login page, and Version2, a dynamic login page. While both versions were prepared for deployment, only Version2, the dynamic login page, was ultimately hosted on ECS using Fargate.
